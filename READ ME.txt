-------------------
TIPS AND TRICKS
-------------------
- Turrets fire bullets accurately so they are good in the early game
- Turrets can be useful mid/late waves when you want to teleport out of black hole
- Placing a Blackhole just before a wave starts can help you clear the wave quickly.
- Combining a blackhole and a bomb can be deadly.
- Remember to construct walls. Enemies cannot pass by walls whereas you can. Walls are particularly useful vs the enemies that follow you
- Collect as many powerups as you can.
-When a blackhole finishes, enemies will scatter around the canvas. Remember to use your 'c' which pushes enemies back when they converge on you.
- Toggle addon when boss turns green. The addon bullets will heal him.
- You can place a maximum of 5 turrets at a time.
- You can place infinite amount of walls but you need to collect them.

BUGS
------
- Audio issue when attack speed is too fast.
- Audio issue where background music stops playing after a while.
- No audio for many abilities, new wave, lose life etc.
- I hate the sound effects
- No main menu/ pause (I won't be adding these for this game)
-when bomb goes off during new wave start timer, bomb exceeds its max radius
- There should be no other bugs

EDIT: no audio at all. *facepalm*
